<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project started as a personal challenge/venture, but when I realized how much it helped my close friends discord server. I decided I wanted to make the project more professional, and above all, OPEN SOURCE!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To add this bot to your own discord server, simply click this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=786721755560804373&permissions=8&scope=bot) and it choose the server you would like the bot in! 

And just like that the bot is ready to go!

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

On startup of the bot, you will want to use `!registerguild` to make sure your guild is indexed in our databases! If your server supports private threads also be sure to use `!setticketchannel` in the channel of your choice for tickets to be created.

#### Current Command List for AudioPlayer:

- `-play` - Add a link to most streaming platforms, or use its name to search!
- `-skip` - Skips the current song!
- `-volume` - a number 1-100 to adjust volume!
- `-clear` - clears the current queue!
- `-stop` or `-pause` - pauses the current playing audio!
- `-resume` - resumes the current queue!
- `-disconnect` or `-dc` or `-leave` - disconnects the bot from its channel!
- `-follow` or `-move` moves the bot to your current channel!
- `-queue` or `-q`  - Shows a Embed of songs (10 per page) with page selectors, and a button to remove the message!
- `-shuffle` - Shuffles the queue!
- `-song` or `-info` - Shows info about the song, including a progress bar, the song requester, and Title/Author!
- `-remove` - Removes a song from the queue at a given index number!
- `-seek` - Takes in arg in the form of `HH:mm:ss` that seeks to that time in the current song!
- `-fix` - Resets the VoiceChannel's region to help reduce latency and audio lag.
- `-loop` - Args are either `song` or `queue` to loop a song or to loop the entire queue! (_Skipping resets any loops!_)
- `-move` - Intakes to numbers and swaps their positions in the queue!
- `-hijack` - Secret Command ðŸ¤«**Only Accessible by certified DJ's!**
- `-playtop` or `-ptop` - Adds a song to the top of the queue.
